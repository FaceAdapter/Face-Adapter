## Introduction
Face-Adapter is an efficient and effective face editing adapter for pre-trained diffusion models, specifically targeting face reenactment and swapping tasks.

## Release
- [2024/5/25] ðŸ”¥ We release the [gradio demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/FaceAdapter/FaceAdapter).
- [2024/5/24] ðŸ”¥ We release the code and models.


## Installation

```
# Torch >= 2.0 recommended for acceleration without xformers
pip install accelerate diffusers==0.26.0 insightface onnxruntime

```

## Download Models

You can download models of FaceAdapter directly from [here](https://huggingface.co/FaceAdapter/FaceAdapter/tree/main) or download using python script:
```python
# Download all files 
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download(repo_id="FaceAdapter/FaceAdapter", local_dir="./checkpoints")

# If you want to download one specific file
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
hf_hub_download(repo_id="FaceAdapter/FaceAdapter", filename="controlnet/config.json", local_dir="./checkpoints")
```


To run the demo, you should also download the pre-trained SD models below:
- [runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5)
- [stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse)
<!-- - [SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V4.0_noVAE](https://huggingface.co/SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V4.0_noVAE) -->

## âš¡ Quick Inference

### SD_1.5
```python
python infer.py 
```

You can adjust the cropping size with the ```--crop_ratio``` ï¼ˆdefault:0.81ï¼‰parameter. But be careful not to set the crop range too large, as this can decrease the quality of the generated images due to the limit of the training data size.


ðŸ˜Š FaceAdapter can be seamlessly plugged into community models:
```python
python infer.py --base_model "frankjoshua/toonyou_beta6"
```
